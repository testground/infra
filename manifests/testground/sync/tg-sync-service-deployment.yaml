# Notes:
# testground (storm) tests failing when using more than 40 instances/pods; sync-service showed an OOMkilled error
# The solution was to increase requests for the sync service pod from 20cpu/20MB RAM to 120cpu/130MB, and also increase the limits as well just as a buffer for larger deployments
# Also, with these values we are able to reach the hardware limits of the c5.4xlarge nodes, so there is no point in increasing them further.
